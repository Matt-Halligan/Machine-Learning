# Machine-Learning
I explore the foundations of machine learning and the sub-field of deep learning utilizing a mix of pre-made and custom mathematics for machine learning libraries, synthesizing seminal research including "Attention is All You Need," and building and adapting system workflows to train, deploy, and evolve ML/ML Ops architectures.
